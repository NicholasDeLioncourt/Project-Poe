# Project-Poe

I name all my personal coding projects according to 
my favorite writers:

* (Lord) Byron, 
* (Ayn) Rand, 
* (Nathaniel) Hawthorne, 
* (Jack) London,
* etc &c.

This one is; of course, Project (Edgar Allan) Poe.

This should be sufficient evidence to prove that
coding too long leads to variations of nerd insanity.
