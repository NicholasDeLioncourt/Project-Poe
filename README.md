# Project.Poe

I name all my personal coding projects according to 
my favorite writers:

* (Lord) Byron, 
* (Ayn) Rand, 
* (Nathaniel) Hawthorne, 
* (Jack) London,
* etc &c.

And now; of course, Project (Edgar Allan) Poe.

Not so strange; at least I did not choose great
moments in potato history.

This should be sufficient evidence to prove that
coding too long leads to variations of nerd insanity.
